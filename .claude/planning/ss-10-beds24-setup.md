# [Infrastructure] Beds24 Account Setup & Configuration

## Overview

Create and fully configure a Beds24 account for booking management, including property setup, pricing rules, availability calendar, payment gateway (Stripe), and widget generation.

**Infrastructure Type:** Configuration (Third-party Service)
**Impact:** Enables booking functionality for Sumba Sunset website
**Risk Level:** Medium (paid service, requires significant configuration time)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Read First**

- üìã [Beds24 Feasibility Research](./beds24-feasibility-research.md) - Read this first to understand technical risks, cost-benefit analysis, and why we chose Beds24
- This document contains **ONLY implementation steps**
- All "why" and "what if" analysis is in the feasibility research doc

**Configuration Components:**

1. **Account Setup** - Create Beds24 account, choose pricing plan
2. **Property Configuration** - Add property details, rooms, capacity
3. **Pricing System** - Base rates, seasonal pricing, weekend rates
4. **Availability Rules** - Min/max nights, advance booking, buffer days
5. **Payment Gateway** - Connect Stripe, configure deposit rules
6. **Booking Widget** - Generate embed code, test functionality
7. **Email Automation** - Booking confirmation, pre-arrival, check-in, post-stay
8. **API Keys** - Obtain account + property keys for integration

**‚ö†Ô∏è Currency Decision:** This task sets up Beds24 with USD initially. **SS-16 (Currency Investigation)** in this same milestone will investigate switching to IDR. If you decide on IDR, you'll update the Beds24 currency setting before completing this milestone. This ensures marketing pages (M5-6) are built with the correct currency from the start.

**Symptoms:** Same room booked twice for overlapping dates

**Solutions:**

1. Check if buffer days are set up correctly
2. Verify room quantities are correct
3. Ensure channel sync is working (if using OTAs)
4. Manually block dates if needed
5. Contact affected guests immediately

#### Issue: Widget looks broken on mobile

**Symptoms:** Layout issues, text too small, buttons not tappable

**Solutions:**

1. This is expected - default widget is not mobile-optimized
2. Wait for SS-10 (widget CSS customization)
3. Or: Add quick CSS fixes:
   ```css
   @media (max-width: 768px) {
     .beds24-widget {
       font-size: 14px;
     }
     .beds24-button {
       min-height: 44px;
     }
   }
   ```

## Best Practices & Security

### Optimization Tips

1. **Mobile-First Testing**
   - Always test on real mobile device (not just browser resize)
   - Primary users will book on phones
   - Widget customization is critical (SS-10)

2. **Pricing Strategy**
   - Research competitor prices in Sumba
   - Set competitive rates for direct bookings
   - Consider OTA pricing (usually 15-20% higher to cover commissions)
   - Review and adjust seasonally

3. **Guest Communication**
   - Respond quickly to inquiries (within 2 hours ideal)
   - Set up WhatsApp Business for quick responses
   - Automate FAQs where possible
   - Be friendly and helpful (surf vibe!)

4. **Calendar Management**
   - Update availability daily
   - Block maintenance dates in advance
   - Use buffer days if you need cleaning time
   - Mark external bookings immediately

5. **Photo Updates**
   - Refresh photos annually
   - Add new photos of improvements
   - Seasonal photos (dry season vs. wet season)
   - Guest photos (with permission) show real experience

6. **Review Management**
   - Request reviews from happy guests
   - Respond to all reviews (positive and negative)
   - Address issues mentioned in negative reviews
   - Showcase best reviews on website

### Security

1. **API Keys**
   - Never commit to git
   - Store only in `.env.local` (local) and Vercel Dashboard (production)
   - Rotate keys annually or if compromised
   - Don't share in Slack/email/Discord

2. **Guest Data**
   - GDPR compliance (even in Indonesia, good practice)
   - Store only necessary data
   - Delete old booking data periodically
   - Secure payment info (Beds24 + Stripe handle this)

3. **Access Control**
   - Use strong password for Beds24 account
   - Enable two-factor authentication if available
   - Limit staff access to what they need
   - Log out of shared devices

## Rollback Plan

If Beds24 setup fails or is not suitable:

1. **Cancel Beds24 subscription** (within trial if applicable, or monthly plan)
2. **Remove API keys** from `.env.local`
3. **Evaluate alternatives**:
   - Option A: Try Smoobu (original plan) - higher cost but easier
   - Option B: Try Hospitable ($25/month) - middle ground
   - Option C: Build custom solution (3-4 weeks) - no recurring fees
4. **Update all planning docs** to reflect platform change
5. **No code rollback needed** (SS-10 not yet implemented)

**Rollback Risk:** Low (configuration only, no code changes yet)
**Rollback Time:** 1 hour (cancel + document)
**Financial Risk:** One month fee only ($40-50)

## Notes

**Important Reminders:**

1. **Take screenshots** of all key settings for documentation
2. **Document pricing strategy** (why these rates, why seasonal variations)
3. **Test on real mobile device** (not just browser resize)
4. **Verify API keys work** before considering task complete
5. **Budget 8-12 hours** for full setup (don't rush)
6. **Mobile-first widget** customization is critical (addressed in SS-10)

- **Payment rules** - Deposit model may be tricky to configure
- **Time zone** - Verify Sumba time zone (WITA) configured correctly
- **Currency** - USD confirmed (see frontmatter). Future spike story (SS-39) will investigate USD‚ÜíIDR switch after Milestone 6
- **Currency** - USD confirmed (see frontmatter). Future spike story (SS-39) will investigate USD‚ÜíIDR switch after Milestone 6

**After Completion:**

1. Monitor first real booking closely
2. Gather guest feedback on booking experience
3. Iterate on email templates based on feedback
4. Track booking abandonment rate
5. A/B test widget placement and design (future)
