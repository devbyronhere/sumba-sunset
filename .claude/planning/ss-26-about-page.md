# [Feature] About Page (Surf Camp Story, Team)

## Overview

Create a compelling About page that tells the Sumba Sunset story, introduces the team, explains the surf camp philosophy, and builds trust with potential guests. This page establishes credibility and emotional connection.

**Project Context:**
Sumba Sunset is a surf camp website (mobile-first, marketing-focused, no database). The About page must:

- üì± Engage mobile readers with visual storytelling
- üèÑ Convey authenticity and passion for surfing
- üí¨ Build trust through team introductions and property history
- üñºÔ∏è Use photos to showcase team and property personality
- üéØ Support booking decisions by reducing uncertainty

**User Story:**
As a potential guest, I want to learn about the surf camp's story and team so that I feel confident this is a trustworthy, authentic experience run by passionate people.

**Business Value:**

- Builds trust and credibility (reduces booking hesitation)
- Differentiates from competitors through storytelling
- Humanizes the brand (team photos and bios)
- Supports SEO with rich, unique content
- Converts skeptical visitors into bookers

- [x] SS-25: Homepage (establishes design patterns)
- [ ] SS-5: shadcn/ui components
- [ ] SS-24: Responsive Images
- [ ] Content from user (story, team bios, photos)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1**: Hero section with about headline and background image
- [ ] **AC2**: Story section explaining surf camp origins and philosophy

## Test Strategy

### Test Files to Create

- `src/__tests__/app/about.test.tsx` - Integration tests for about page rendering
- `src/__tests__/components/TeamCard.test.tsx` - Component tests for team member cards
- `src/__tests__/components/StorySection.test.tsx` - Component tests for story section

### Test Types

- **Integration Tests**: Test about page renders all sections correctly
- **Component Tests**: Test team card component with various props
- **Accessibility Tests**: Test semantic HTML, alt text, keyboard navigation

### Coverage Target

- Minimum **70%** coverage for page and components (UI-heavy)
- **100%** coverage for CTA links and navigation

### Edge Cases to Test

1. **Missing content**: Handle missing team photos or bios gracefully
2. **Long bios**: Text overflow handling in team cards
3. **Various team sizes**: 2 team members vs. 10 team members
4. **Missing images**: Fallback for missing team/property photos

### Performance Benchmarks

- LCP < 2.5s
- CLS < 0.1
- Page weight < 1.5MB
- All images lazy loaded except hero
