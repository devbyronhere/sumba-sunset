# [Infrastructure] Upgrade Twilio WhatsApp to Production Number

## Overview

Upgrade from Twilio Sandbox WhatsApp number (used during development) to a production WhatsApp-enabled Twilio number before official launch. This ensures professional WhatsApp business integration and removes sandbox limitations.

**Infrastructure Type:** Configuration
**Impact:** Production only (contact form WhatsApp integration)
**Risk Level:** Low (simple environment variable update)

**Business Value:**

- Professional WhatsApp integration (no sandbox join code required for guests)
- Reliable message delivery without sandbox limitations
- WhatsApp Business features (profile, verified business badge)
- Better deliverability and trust with Meta/WhatsApp platform
- Consistent sender number (sandbox number can change)

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Situation

During development (SS-4 through SS-35), the contact form uses **Twilio Sandbox** for WhatsApp:

- **Sandbox Number**: `whatsapp:+14155238886` (Twilio's shared test number)
- **Limitation**: Recipients must "join" sandbox by sending a code before receiving messages
- **Not suitable for production**: Guests can't receive messages without joining sandbox first
- **Purpose**: Free testing during development without purchasing production number

### Pain Points

- **Guest friction**: Users can't receive WhatsApp responses without joining Twilio sandbox
- **Not professional**: Sandbox is for testing only, not production use
- **Shared resource**: Sandbox number shared with other Twilio developers
- **No business profile**: Can't set up WhatsApp Business profile with sandbox
- **Rate limits**: Sandbox has stricter rate limits than production

### Desired Outcome

After this task:

- Production WhatsApp-enabled Twilio number purchased and configured
- Staff WhatsApp receives contact form submissions from production number
- No sandbox join code required for guests
- WhatsApp Business profile configured (name, description, profile image)
- All contact form messages use production number
- Environment variables updated in `.env.local` and Vercel

---

## Solution Design

### Proposed Infrastructure

**Simple upgrade process:**

1. Purchase WhatsApp-enabled Twilio phone number (~$1-2/month)
2. Complete Facebook Business verification (required by Meta for WhatsApp)
3. Configure WhatsApp Business profile
4. Update **ONLY** `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` environment variable
5. Test contact form end-to-end with production number

**Key Point:** All other Twilio credentials stay the same (Account SID, Auth Token, Staff WhatsApp Number).

### Architecture/Flow Diagram

```
BEFORE (Sandbox - Development):
Guest submits contact form
    ‚Üì
Next.js API Route
    ‚Üì
Twilio API (Account SID + Auth Token)
    ‚Üì
WhatsApp message FROM: whatsapp:+14155238886 (sandbox)
    ‚Üì
Staff WhatsApp (must have joined sandbox to receive)

AFTER (Production - Launch):
Guest submits contact form
    ‚Üì
Next.js API Route
    ‚Üì
Twilio API (SAME Account SID + Auth Token)
    ‚Üì
WhatsApp message FROM: whatsapp:+1234567890 (your production number)
    ‚Üì
Staff WhatsApp (no sandbox join required)
```

### Tools & Technologies

- **Twilio Phone Number**: WhatsApp-enabled number (~$1-2/month)
- **Facebook Business Manager**: Required for WhatsApp Business verification
- **Twilio Console**: Configure WhatsApp settings
- **Vercel Dashboard**: Update production environment variables
- **.env.local**: Update local development environment

### Configuration Files

Environment variable updates only (no code changes):

- `.env.local` - Update `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` locally
- Vercel Environment Variables - Update `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` in production

### Alternatives Considered

**Alternative 1: Continue with Sandbox**

- Pros: Free, no setup required
- Cons: Not suitable for production, guests can't receive messages
- Why rejected: Not viable for production use

**Alternative 2: Use Different Service (WhatsApp Business API)**

- Pros: Direct Meta integration
- Cons: More expensive, complex setup, requires Facebook Business verification anyway
- Why rejected: Twilio already integrated, simpler upgrade path

**Alternative 3: Use SMS Instead of WhatsApp**

- Pros: No WhatsApp verification needed
- Cons: Staff preference is WhatsApp, higher cost per message
- Why rejected: WhatsApp is staff's preferred communication channel
