## üöÄ Continuous Deployment Strategy

**IMPORTANT: Deploy after every milestone completion to avoid big issues at project end.**

### Deployment Workflow

After completing each milestone:

1. **Verify all quality gates pass** (tests, linting, type-checking)
2. **Create Pull Request** for milestone branch
3. **User reviews, approves and merges to main** PR
4. **Vercel automatically deploys** to production (via GitHub integration)
5. **Verify deployment successful** at production URL
6. **User performs smoke testing** on production site
7. **Document any deployment issues** in retrospective

## üìà Milestones

---

### Milestone 3: Beds24 Setup & Integration + Currency Decision

**Status:** Not Started
**Target Date:** TBD
**Dependencies:** Milestone 2 (requires SS-4 credentials)

**üìã Research & Analysis:**

- [Beds24 Feasibility Research](./beds24-feasibility-research.md) - Technical analysis, risk assessment, and decision rationale for choosing Beds24 over alternatives (Smoobu, custom solution). Covers CORS concerns, Next.js 15 compatibility, hydration issues, and cost-benefit analysis. **Read this first** to understand the "why" before implementation.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] SS-10: Beds24 Integration Validation (30-60 min technical spike)
- [ ] SS-11: Beds24 Account Setup & Configuration (USER creates account, 8-12 hours)
- [ ] SS-12: Beds24 widget integration (basic placeholder booking page)
- [ ] SS-13: Beds24 payment configuration (Stripe integration, 50% deposit model)
- [ ] SS-14: Beds24 email templates (booking confirmation, pre-arrival, post-stay)
- [ ] SS-15: Beds24 widget CSS customization (mobile-first responsive design)
- [ ] SS-16: Currency Switch Spike - Investigate USD ‚Üí IDR migration

**Outcome:** Fully functional booking system with Beds24 widget integrated, payment processing configured, and automated email workflows set up. **Currency decision made** before building marketing pages (avoids rework if switching from USD to IDR).

**Note:** User will create Beds24 account at start of this milestone. Claude will guide through configuration steps in SS-11 planning doc.

**Why Currency Decision Here?** Making the USD vs. IDR decision NOW (before Milestone 5-6 marketing pages) means:

- If you choose IDR, we build all pricing displays with IDR from the start
- No rework needed to update currency formatting in already-built pages
- Beds24 currency is set correctly before any content references it

**Deployment:** After milestone completion, merge to main and deploy. **CRITICAL**: Test end-to-end booking flow in production with real Stripe test cards. Verify email automation triggers correctly. Document currency decision for all future work.

---

### Milestone 4: Communication Features (Basic Placeholders)

**Status:** Not Started
**Target Date:** TBD
**Dependencies:** Milestone 3 (Beds24 + Currency Decision)

**Tasks:**

- [ ] SS-17: Contact form with React Hook Form + Zod (basic placeholder page)
- [ ] SS-18: Twilio integration (WhatsApp forwarding to staff WhatsApp - uses sandbox initially)
- [ ] SS-19: WhatsApp Click-to-Chat button
- [ ] SS-20: Rate limiting for contact form

**Outcome:** Functional communication flows (contact form and WhatsApp) with basic placeholder pages. Validated and working after booking system and currency decision are complete.

**Note:** SS-18 will use Twilio Sandbox (`whatsapp:+14155238886`) for testing. Production WhatsApp number upgrade happens in Milestone 8 before launch.

**Deployment:** After milestone completion, merge to main and deploy. **CRITICAL**: Test contact form ‚Üí Twilio ‚Üí WhatsApp flow in production. Verify rate limiting works.

---

### Milestone 5: Media & Content (Basic Placeholders)

**Status:** Not Started
**Target Date:** TBD
**Dependencies:** Milestone 4 (Communication Features)

**Tasks:**

- [ ] SS-22: Image upload system (Vercel Blob with pre-optimization)
- [ ] SS-23: YouTube video embeds (loop, no ads)
- [ ] SS-24: Image gallery component (basic version)
- [ ] SS-25: Responsive images for mobile/desktop

**Outcome:** Media systems functional with basic placeholder pages. Nice UI comes in Milestone 6.

**Content Strategy:**

- **Images**: Use placeholder images (stock photos or AI-generated mockups) for initial launch
- **Post-Launch**: Professional photographer will visit property and replace placeholders with real photos
- **Copy**: User will provide copy during Milestone 6 (knows property intimately)
- **Currency**: Use currency decided in Milestone 3 for any pricing displays

**Deployment:** After milestone completion, merge to main and deploy. Verify Vercel Blob image uploads work in production, test YouTube embeds, confirm responsive images load correctly.

---

### Milestone 6: Marketing Pages & UI Polish

**Status:** Not Started
**Target Date:** TBD
**Dependencies:** Milestone 5 (Media & Content)

- [ ] SS-28: Rooms & Accommodation page (polished UI)
- [ ] SS-29: Activities & Surf Info page (polished UI)
- [ ] SS-30: Polish contact/booking pages with nice UI
- [ ] SS-31: Mobile-first responsive design across all pages

**Outcome:** All pages have polished, beautiful UI. Site looks professional and ready for users. **Currency from M3 decision is already integrated** throughout all pricing displays.

**Content Workflow:**

- User provides copy for each page as we build it (knows property and area intimately)
- Claude implements UI with user-provided content
- Placeholder images used until professional photography available post-launch
- All pricing displays use currency decided in Milestone 3

**Deployment:** After milestone completion, merge to main and deploy. Perform comprehensive cross-browser and mobile device testing in production. Verify all pages render correctly and currency displays consistently.

---

### Milestone 7: Testing & Quality

**Status:** Not Started
**Target Date:** TBD
**Dependencies:** Milestone 6 (Marketing Pages & UI Polish)

**Tasks:**

- [ ] SS-33: Unit tests for utilities and validations
- [ ] SS-34: Integration tests for forms and API routes
- [ ] SS-35: Mobile device testing
- [ ] SS-36: Performance optimization
- [ ] SS-37: SEO optimization

**Outcome:** Site is tested, optimized, and production-ready. All features work correctly with the currency chosen in Milestone 3.

**Deployment:** After milestone completion, merge to main and deploy. Run full test suite in production environment. Verify performance improvements (Lighthouse scores), confirm SEO meta tags, test on real mobile devices.

---

### Milestone 8: MVP Launch

**Status:** Not Started
**Target Date:** TBD
**Dependencies:** Milestone 7 (Testing & Quality)

**Tasks:**

- [ ] SS-38: Upgrade Twilio WhatsApp to production number (purchase WhatsApp-enabled Twilio number, update environment variables)
- [ ] SS-39: SEO Optimization (meta tags, sitemap.xml, structured data)
- [ ] SS-40: Remove pre-launch banner (set NEXT_PUBLIC_PRE_LAUNCH=false)
- [ ] SS-41: Final pre-launch checklist (comprehensive QA)
- [ ] SS-42: Go live announcement! (social media, press, etc.)

**Outcome:** Fully functional, tested, and polished surf camp website publicly launched at sumbasunset.com with chosen currency (USD or IDR from M3 decision) and production WhatsApp integration.

**Pre-Launch Upgrade (SS-38):**

- Purchase WhatsApp-enabled Twilio number (~$1-2/month)
- Complete Facebook Business verification for WhatsApp
- Update ONLY `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` in `.env.local` and Vercel (all other credentials stay the same)
- Test end-to-end contact form flow with production number

**Deployment:** This milestone **does NOT require new deployment** - the site is already live on sumbasunset.com from previous milestones. This milestone simply:

1. Upgrades Twilio to production WhatsApp number
2. Removes privacy controls (banner + robots.txt)
3. Performs final QA
4. Makes public announcement

The site has been production-tested throughout development with the correct currency and Twilio sandbox. Launch requires only upgrading the WhatsApp number and flipping the "public" switch.
