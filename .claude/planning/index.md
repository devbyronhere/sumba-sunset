## üìù Decision Log

### Decision 1: Use Next.js 15 with App Router

**Date:** 2025-01-17
**Context:** Need modern React framework with SSR/SSG capabilities
**Decision:** Use Next.js 15 with App Router (not Pages Router)
**Rationale:**

- Server Components by default (better performance)
- Improved data fetching patterns
- Built-in optimizations
- Future-proof architecture

**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented in SS-1

---

### Decision 2: Wrapper Script Pattern for Git Hooks

**Date:** 2025-01-17
**Context:** Need flexible, maintainable git hook system
**Decision:** Use wrapper scripts (`_git:*` ‚Üí `code:*`) instead of direct commands in hooks
**Rationale:**

- Easy to add type-checking and tests later without editing shell scripts
- Discoverable: can run `yarn code:pre-commit` manually
- Consistent with ea-inclusion project pattern
- Simpler to chain multiple commands in package.json

**Alternatives Considered:**

- Direct commands in Husky hooks (rejected: harder to maintain)
- Complex shell scripts (rejected: less discoverable)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented in SS-2

---

### Decision 3: Planning Document System

**Date:** 2025-01-17
**Context:** Need reliable task tracking and implementation verification
**Decision:** Use markdown planning documents with metadata, checklists, and TDD approach
**Rationale:**

- Version controlled alongside code
- No external dependencies (Jira, etc.)
- Clear source of truth for work history
- Enables retrospective review
- Forces planning before implementation
- Integrates with Claude Code workflow

**Status:** ‚úÖ Active system

---

### Decision 4: Use Beds24 Instead of Smoobu for Booking Management

**Date:** 2025-01-19
**Context:** Need booking management system with payment processing and channel manager
**Decision:** Use Beds24 (¬£3.50/month or $40-50/month) instead of Smoobu ($128.56/month + 0.9% booking fees)
**Rationale:**

- **Cost savings**: ~$1,267/year (Beds24 base plan vs Smoobu with fees)
- **No booking commission**: Beds24 has flat monthly fee, Smoobu charges 0.9% per booking
- **Built-in channel manager**: Syncs with Booking.com, Airbnb, Agoda (same as Smoobu)
- **Stripe integration**: Supports 50% deposit model required by client
- **Adequate features**: All required functionality present despite dated UI

**Trade-offs Accepted:**

- **Dated UI**: Less modern interface than Smoobu (mitigated with CSS customization)
- **Longer setup time**: 3-5 days vs 1-2 days for Smoobu (acceptable for cost savings)
- **More technical**: Requires CSS knowledge for widget customization (Claude can handle)
- **Manual configuration**: Channel manager setup less automated (one-time setup cost)

**Alternatives Considered:**

- Smoobu (rejected: 3x more expensive, booking fees add up)
- Building custom system (rejected: too complex, payment processing difficult)
- Manual calendar management (rejected: no payment processing, error-prone)

**Migration Strategy:**

If Beds24's UI becomes a conversion problem (users abandoning bookings):

1. First: Heavily customize CSS to modernize widget appearance
2. Second: Build custom booking form using Beds24 API backend
3. Last resort: Migrate to Smoobu or similar if revenue justifies cost

**Status:** üöß To be implemented in SS-5

## üéì Key Learnings Repository

### From SS-1 (Next.js Setup)

- Next.js 15 creates App Router structure by default
- Turbopack is now default in dev mode (much faster)
- TypeScript strict mode catches issues early

### From SS-2 (Linting Setup)

- Wrapper script pattern makes hooks more maintainable
- lint-staged on pre-commit + full check on pre-push is ideal balance
- Prettier should run on ALL files, ESLint only on JS/TS
