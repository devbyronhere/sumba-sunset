## 📝 Decision Log

### Decision 1: Use Next.js 15 with App Router

**Date:** 2025-01-17
**Context:** Need modern React framework with SSR/SSG capabilities
**Decision:** Use Next.js 15 with App Router (not Pages Router)
**Rationale:**

- Server Components by default (better performance)
- Improved data fetching patterns
- Built-in optimizations
- Future-proof architecture

**Status:** ✅ Implemented in SS-1

---

### Decision 2: Wrapper Script Pattern for Git Hooks

**Date:** 2025-01-17
**Context:** Need flexible, maintainable git hook system
**Decision:** Use wrapper scripts (`_git:*` → `code:*`) instead of direct commands in hooks
**Rationale:**

- Easy to add type-checking and tests later without editing shell scripts
- Discoverable: can run `yarn code:pre-commit` manually
- Consistent with ea-inclusion project pattern
- Simpler to chain multiple commands in package.json

**Alternatives Considered:**

- Direct commands in Husky hooks (rejected: harder to maintain)
- Complex shell scripts (rejected: less discoverable)

**Status:** ✅ Implemented in SS-2

---

### Decision 3: Planning Document System

**Date:** 2025-01-17
**Context:** Need reliable task tracking and implementation verification
**Decision:** Use markdown planning documents with metadata, checklists, and TDD approach
**Rationale:**

- Version controlled alongside code
- No external dependencies (Jira, etc.)
- Clear source of truth for work history
- Enables retrospective review
- Forces planning before implementation
- Integrates with Claude Code workflow

**Status:** ✅ Active system

## 🎓 Key Learnings Repository

### From SS-1 (Next.js Setup)

- Next.js 15 creates App Router structure by default
- Turbopack is now default in dev mode (much faster)
- TypeScript strict mode catches issues early

### From SS-2 (Linting Setup)

- Wrapper script pattern makes hooks more maintainable
- lint-staged on pre-commit + full check on pre-push is ideal balance
- Prettier should run on ALL files, ESLint only on JS/TS

## 📖 How to Use This Index

### Adding a New Task

1. Copy appropriate template from `.claude/planning/_templates/`
2. Rename to `ss-X-task-name.md` (use next available ID)
3. Fill in all metadata and sections
4. Add entry to "Not Started" section above
5. Update dependency graph if needed
6. Link from related tasks

### Starting a Task

1. Move task from "Not Started" to "In Progress"
2. Update frontmatter in task file: `status: in_progress`
3. Add `started` timestamp
4. Update "Current Sprint Focus" if high priority

### Completing a Task

1. Verify ALL quality gates pass in task document
2. Add retrospective notes to task document
3. Move task from "In Progress" to "Completed"
4. Update frontmatter: `status: completed`, add `completed` and `actual_time`
5. Update statistics and milestones as needed
6. Create follow-up tasks if discovered during implementation

### Blocking a Task

1. Move task to "Blocked" section
2. Update frontmatter: `status: blocked`
3. Add clear note explaining blocker
4. Create task to resolve blocker if possible
5. Notify team/user if external blocker
