---

## üöÄ Continuous Deployment Strategy

**IMPORTANT: Deploy after every milestone completion to avoid big issues at project end.**

### Deployment Workflow

After completing each milestone:

1. **Verify all quality gates pass** (tests, linting, type-checking)
2. **Create Pull Request** for milestone branch
3. **User reviews and approves** PR
4. **Merge to main** branch
5. **Vercel automatically deploys** to production (via GitHub integration)
6. **Verify deployment successful** at production URL
7. **User performs smoke testing** on production site
8. **Document any deployment issues** in retrospective

### Why Continuous Deployment?

- **Early issue detection**: Catch deployment problems early, not at launch
- **Incremental validation**: Each milestone is production-tested
- **Reduced risk**: Small, frequent deployments are safer than one big bang
- **Real environment testing**: Test integrations (Beds24, Twilio) in production
- **Confidence building**: Progressive validation that everything works
- **Rollback simplicity**: Easy to revert small changes vs. large releases

### Vercel Deployment Process

**Automatic Deployments:**

- Every push to `main` ‚Üí Production deployment
- Every PR branch ‚Üí Preview deployment
- GitHub integration handles all automation

**What Gets Deployed:**

- Next.js application build
- Environment variables (configured in Vercel Dashboard)
- Static assets
- API routes

**Deployment Strategy:**

- Deploy to **live domain (sumbasunset.com)** after each milestone merge
- Use `robots.txt` and "under construction" banner for pre-launch privacy
- Zero cutover risk at official launch (just remove banner)
- Catch DNS/SSL/domain issues early in development

**Post-Deployment Checklist (After Each Milestone):**

- [ ] Deployment succeeded (check Vercel dashboard)
- [ ] Production site loads at https://sumbasunset.com
- [ ] SSL certificate active (HTTPS green padlock)
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools
- [ ] New features from milestone are visible and functional
- [ ] No regressions in existing features
- [ ] Environment variables working correctly (if applicable)
- [ ] Mobile experience acceptable (test on real device)

---

### Milestone 3: Beds24 Setup & Integration + Currency Decision

**Status:** Not Started
**Target Date:** TBD
**Dependencies:** Milestone 2 (requires SS-5 credentials)

**üìã Research & Analysis:**

- [Beds24 Feasibility Research](./beds24-feasibility-research.md) - Technical analysis, risk assessment, and decision rationale for choosing Beds24 over alternatives (Smoobu, custom solution). Covers CORS concerns, Next.js 15 compatibility, hydration issues, and cost-benefit analysis. **Read this first** to understand the "why" before implementation.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] SS-10: Beds24 Integration Validation (30-60 min technical spike)
- [ ] SS-11: Beds24 Account Setup & Configuration (USER creates account, 8-12 hours)
- [ ] SS-12: Beds24 widget integration (basic placeholder booking page)
- [ ] SS-13: Beds24 payment configuration (Stripe integration, 50% deposit model)
- [ ] SS-14: Beds24 email templates (booking confirmation, pre-arrival, post-stay)
- [ ] SS-15: Beds24 widget CSS customization (mobile-first responsive design)
- [ ] SS-16: Currency Switch Spike - Investigate USD ‚Üí IDR migration

**Outcome:** Fully functional booking system with Beds24 widget integrated, payment processing configured, and automated email workflows set up. **Currency decision made** before building marketing pages (avoids rework if switching from USD to IDR).

**Note:** User will create Beds24 account at start of this milestone. Claude will guide through configuration steps in SS-11 planning doc.

**Why Currency Decision Here?** Making the USD vs. IDR decision NOW (before Milestone 5-6 marketing pages) means:

- If you choose IDR, we build all pricing displays with IDR from the start
- No rework needed to update currency formatting in already-built pages
- Beds24 currency is set correctly before any content references it

**Deployment:** After milestone completion, merge to main and deploy. **CRITICAL**: Test end-to-end booking flow in production with real Stripe test cards. Verify email automation triggers correctly. Document currency decision for all future work.

---

### Milestone 4: Communication Features (Basic Placeholders)

**Status:** Not Started
**Target Date:** TBD
**Dependencies:** Milestone 3 (Beds24 + Currency Decision)

**Tasks:**

- [ ] SS-17: Contact form with React Hook Form + Zod (basic placeholder page)
- [ ] SS-18: Twilio integration (WhatsApp forwarding to +27 78 778 7591)
- [ ] SS-19: WhatsApp Click-to-Chat button
- [ ] SS-20: Rate limiting for contact form

**Outcome:** Functional communication flows (contact form and WhatsApp) with basic placeholder pages. Validated and working after booking system and currency decision are complete.

**Deployment:** After milestone completion, merge to main and deploy. **CRITICAL**: Test contact form ‚Üí Twilio ‚Üí WhatsApp flow in production. Verify rate limiting works.

---

### Milestone 5: Media & Content (Basic Placeholders)

- [ ] SS-23: Image gallery component (basic version)
- [ ] SS-24: Responsive images for mobile/desktop

**Outcome:** Media systems functional with basic placeholder pages. Nice UI comes in Milestone 6.

**Content Strategy:**

- **Images**: Use placeholder images (stock photos or AI-generated mockups) for initial launch
- **Post-Launch**: Professional photographer will visit property and replace placeholders with real photos
- **Copy**: User will provide copy during Milestone 6 (knows property intimately)
- **Currency**: Use currency decided in Milestone 3 for any pricing displays

**Deployment:** After milestone completion, merge to main and deploy. Verify Vercel Blob image uploads work in production, test YouTube embeds, confirm responsive images load correctly.

---

### Milestone 6: Marketing Pages & UI Polish

**Status:** Not Started
**Target Date:** TBD
**Dependencies:** Milestone 5 (Media & Content)

**Tasks:**

**Outcome:** All pages have polished, beautiful UI. Site looks professional and ready for users. **Currency from M3 decision is already integrated** throughout all pricing displays.

**Content Workflow:**

- User provides copy for each page as we build it (knows property and area intimately)
- Claude implements UI with user-provided content
- Placeholder images used until professional photography available post-launch
- All pricing displays use currency decided in Milestone 3

**Deployment:** After milestone completion, merge to main and deploy. Perform comprehensive cross-browser and mobile device testing in production. Verify all pages render correctly and currency displays consistently.

**Deployment:** This milestone **does NOT require new deployment** - the site is already live on sumbasunset.com from previous milestones. This milestone simply:

1. Removes privacy controls (banner + robots.txt)
2. Performs final QA
3. Makes public announcement

The site has been production-tested throughout development with the correct currency. Launch is just flipping the "public" switch.

## üìù Decision Log

### Decision 1: Use Next.js 15 with App Router

**Date:** 2025-01-17
**Context:** Need modern React framework with SSR/SSG capabilities
**Decision:** Use Next.js 15 with App Router (not Pages Router)
**Rationale:**

- Server Components by default (better performance)
- Improved data fetching patterns
- Built-in optimizations
- Future-proof architecture

**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented in SS-1

---

### Decision 2: Wrapper Script Pattern for Git Hooks

**Date:** 2025-01-17
**Context:** Need flexible, maintainable git hook system
**Decision:** Use wrapper scripts (`_git:*` ‚Üí `code:*`) instead of direct commands in hooks
**Rationale:**

- Easy to add type-checking and tests later without editing shell scripts
- Discoverable: can run `yarn code:pre-commit` manually
- Consistent with ea-inclusion project pattern
- Simpler to chain multiple commands in package.json

**Alternatives Considered:**

- Direct commands in Husky hooks (rejected: harder to maintain)
- Complex shell scripts (rejected: less discoverable)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented in SS-2

---

### Decision 3: Planning Document System

**Date:** 2025-01-17
**Context:** Need reliable task tracking and implementation verification
**Decision:** Use markdown planning documents with metadata, checklists, and TDD approach
**Rationale:**

- Version controlled alongside code
- No external dependencies (Jira, etc.)
- Clear source of truth for work history
- Enables retrospective review
- Forces planning before implementation
- Integrates with Claude Code workflow

**Status:** ‚úÖ Active system

---

### Decision 4: Use Beds24 Instead of Smoobu for Booking Management

**Date:** 2025-01-19
**Context:** Need booking management system with payment processing and channel manager
**Decision:** Use Beds24 (¬£3.50/month or $40-50/month) instead of Smoobu ($128.56/month + 0.9% booking fees)
**Rationale:**

- **Cost savings**: ~$1,267/year (Beds24 base plan vs Smoobu with fees)
- **No booking commission**: Beds24 has flat monthly fee, Smoobu charges 0.9% per booking
- **Built-in channel manager**: Syncs with Booking.com, Airbnb, Agoda (same as Smoobu)
- **Stripe integration**: Supports 50% deposit model required by client
- **Adequate features**: All required functionality present despite dated UI

**Trade-offs Accepted:**

- **Dated UI**: Less modern interface than Smoobu (mitigated with CSS customization)
- **Longer setup time**: 3-5 days vs 1-2 days for Smoobu (acceptable for cost savings)
- **More technical**: Requires CSS knowledge for widget customization (Claude can handle)
- **Manual configuration**: Channel manager setup less automated (one-time setup cost)

**Alternatives Considered:**

- Smoobu (rejected: 3x more expensive, booking fees add up)
- Building custom system (rejected: too complex, payment processing difficult)
- Manual calendar management (rejected: no payment processing, error-prone)

**Migration Strategy:**

If Beds24's UI becomes a conversion problem (users abandoning bookings):

1. First: Heavily customize CSS to modernize widget appearance
2. Second: Build custom booking form using Beds24 API backend
3. Last resort: Migrate to Smoobu or similar if revenue justifies cost

**Status:** üöß To be implemented in SS-10

## üéì Key Learnings Repository

### From SS-1 (Next.js Setup)

- Next.js 15 creates App Router structure by default
- Turbopack is now default in dev mode (much faster)
- TypeScript strict mode catches issues early

### From SS-2 (Linting Setup)

- Wrapper script pattern makes hooks more maintainable
- lint-staged on pre-commit + full check on pre-push is ideal balance
- Prettier should run on ALL files, ESLint only on JS/TS
