## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Steps

- [ ] Reproduce bug locally
- [ ] Check error logs
- [ ] Review related code
- [ ] Identify root cause
- [ ] Document findings

### Root Cause

_What is causing this bug?_

### Affected Code

**Files involved:**

- `src/path/to/file.ts:123` - Description of issue
- `src/path/to/other.ts:456` - Description of related issue

---

## Prerequisites/Dependencies

- [ ] Bug reproduced locally
- [ ] Root cause identified
- [ ] Related code reviewed
- [ ] Existing tests reviewed (if any)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1**: Bug no longer occurs when following reproduction steps
- [ ] **AC2**: Existing functionality still works correctly
- [ ] **AC3**: No new console errors or warnings
- [ ] **AC4**: Regression test added to prevent bug from returning
- [ ] **AC5**: Edge cases handled properly

---

## Test Strategy

### Test Files to Create/Update

- `src/__tests__/[feature].test.ts` - Add regression test
- `src/__tests__/[bugfix].test.ts` - Create new test file if needed

### Test Types

- **Regression Test**: Ensure bug doesn't return
- **Unit Tests**: Test fixed code in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Verify fix doesn't break related features

### Coverage Target

- **100%** coverage for bug fix code
- Add regression test that would have caught this bug

### Test Cases

1. **Regression Test**: Reproduce original bug scenario (should pass after fix)
2. **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions related to bug
3. **Related Features**: Ensure fix doesn't break related functionality
4. **Performance**: Verify fix doesn't introduce performance issues (if applicable)

---

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Reproduce & Write Tests (TDD)

- [ ] **Step 1.1**: Reproduce bug locally with exact steps
- [ ] **Step 1.2**: Write failing test that reproduces the bug
- [ ] **Step 1.3**: Verify test fails with current code
- [ ] **Step 1.4**: Write additional tests for edge cases
- [ ] **Step 1.5**: Document expected behavior in tests

**TDD Checkpoint:** Tests written that reproduce the bug

---

### Phase 2: Fix Implementation

- [ ] **Step 2.1**: Implement minimal fix for root cause
- [ ] **Step 2.2**: Run regression test - verify it now passes
- [ ] **Step 2.3**: Run all related tests - verify no regressions
- [ ] **Step 2.4**: Test edge cases manually
- [ ] **Step 2.5**: Add defensive code if needed (input validation, error handling)

**Fix Checkpoint:** Bug fixed and regression test passes

---

### Phase 3: Verification & Prevention

- [ ] **Step 3.1**: Run full test suite
- [ ] **Step 3.2**: Manually test original reproduction steps
- [ ] **Step 3.3**: Test related features for regressions
- [ ] **Step 3.4**: Check for similar bugs in codebase
- [ ] **Step 3.5**: Add JSDoc comments explaining the fix
- [ ] **Step 3.6**: Update error messages if applicable

**Verification Checkpoint:** All tests passing, no regressions found

---

### Phase 4: Documentation

- [ ] **Step 4.1**: Update code comments near fix
- [ ] **Step 4.2**: Add/update JSDoc if function signature changed
- [ ] **Step 4.3**: Update README if user-facing behavior changed
- [ ] **Step 4.4**: Document in changelog (if maintained)
- [ ] **Step 4.5**: Add notes about what caused bug and how to prevent similar ones

**Documentation Checkpoint:** Fix properly documented

---

---

## Post-Implementation Verification

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Bug Reproduction Test**
   - [ ] Follow original reproduction steps
   - [ ] Verify bug no longer occurs
   - [ ] Check console for errors

2. **Regression Testing**
   - [ ] Test related features
   - [ ] Verify nothing else broke
   - [ ] Test edge cases manually

3. **Different Environments** (if applicable)
   - [ ] Test in different browsers
   - [ ] Test on different devices
   - [ ] Test with different data sets

4. **Performance Check**
   - [ ] Verify fix doesn't impact performance
   - [ ] Check for memory leaks
   - [ ] Monitor load times

---

## Rollback Plan

If this fix causes issues:

1. **Revert commit**: `git revert <commit-hash>`
2. **Remove tests**: Delete regression tests if they cause issues
3. **Restore previous behavior**: Ensure original code is restored
4. **Re-open bug ticket**: Document why fix was reverted
5. **Plan alternative fix**: Investigate different approach

**Rollback Risk:** Low | Medium | High
