# [Refactor] Short Descriptive Title

## Overview

Brief description of what code will be refactored and why.

**Refactor Type:** Architecture | Performance | Readability | Maintainability
**Impact:** High | Medium | Low
**Risk Level:** High | Medium | Low

**Business Justification:**

- Why this refactor is worth the time investment
- What problems it solves
- What future work it enables

## Current State Analysis

### What's Wrong with Current Code?

Describe the issues with current implementation:

- Issue 1
- Issue 2
- Issue 3

### Code Smells Identified

- [ ] **Duplicated code** - Same logic in multiple places
- [ ] **Long functions** - Functions doing too many things
- [ ] **Large classes** - Classes with too many responsibilities
- [ ] **Long parameter lists** - Functions with many parameters
- [ ] **Divergent change** - One class/function changing for multiple reasons
- [ ] **Shotgun surgery** - One change requiring edits in many places
- [ ] **Feature envy** - Function using data from another class more than its own
- [ ] **Data clumps** - Same group of data appearing together repeatedly
- [ ] **Primitive obsession** - Using primitives instead of small objects
- [ ] **Complex conditionals** - Nested if/else that's hard to follow
- [ ] **Cryptic naming** - Unclear variable/function names
- [ ] **Dead code** - Unused code still in codebase

### Technical Debt Being Addressed

## Prerequisites/Dependencies

- [ ] All existing tests passing
- [ ] Test coverage sufficient (‚â•80%)
- [ ] No active features depending on code structure
- [ ] Related PRs merged (if applicable)
- [ ] Stakeholders notified of refactor

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1**: All existing tests still pass after refactor
- [ ] **AC2**: No change in external behavior or API
- [ ] **AC3**: Code complexity reduced (measurable via linting)
- [ ] **AC4**: Code coverage maintained or improved
- [ ] **AC5**: Performance maintained or improved
- [ ] **AC6**: New code follows project conventions

---

## Test Strategy

### Existing Tests

- [ ] Identify all tests covering code to refactor
- [ ] Ensure comprehensive test coverage BEFORE refactoring
- [ ] Document any gaps in test coverage

**Test Files:**

- `src/__tests__/[feature].test.ts` - Current coverage: X%

### Additional Tests Needed

- [ ] Add tests for edge cases not currently covered
- [ ] Add integration tests if missing
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks if applicable

### Test Approach

1. **Before Refactoring**: Ensure all tests pass
2. **During Refactoring**: Run tests frequently (after each small change)
3. **After Refactoring**: Verify all tests still pass, no behavior changed

**Regression Prevention:**

- Tests act as safety net during refactor
- If tests fail, refactor introduced a bug
- Must fix immediately before proceeding

### Coverage Target

- Maintain existing coverage (minimum X%)
- Add tests for newly created functions/modules
- Target: ‚â•80% coverage for refactored code

---

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Preparation & Safety Net

- [ ] **Step 1.1**: Run full test suite, verify all passing
- [ ] **Step 1.2**: Check current test coverage
- [ ] **Step 1.3**: Add missing tests for code to be refactored
- [ ] **Step 1.4**: Document current behavior in tests
- [ ] **Step 1.5**: Create feature branch for refactor
- [ ] **Step 1.6**: Set up performance benchmarks (if applicable)

**Safety Net Checkpoint:** Comprehensive tests in place, all passing

---

### Phase 2: Incremental Refactoring

**Refactor in small, safe steps. Run tests after EACH step.**

- [ ] **Step 2.1**: Refactor Step 1 (describe specific change)
  - Make minimal change
  - Run tests - verify passing
  - Commit if tests pass
- [ ] **Step 2.2**: Refactor Step 2 (describe specific change)
  - Make minimal change
  - Run tests - verify passing
  - Commit if tests pass
- [ ] **Step 2.3**: Refactor Step 3 (describe specific change)
  - Make minimal change
  - Run tests - verify passing
  - Commit if tests pass
- [ ] **Step 2.4**: Refactor Step 4 (describe specific change)
  - Make minimal change
  - Run tests - verify passing
  - Commit if tests pass
- [ ] **Step 2.5**: Continue incremental refactoring...

**Refactoring Checkpoint:** Each step complete with passing tests

---

### Phase 3: Cleanup & Optimization

- [ ] **Step 3.1**: Remove dead code
- [ ] **Step 3.2**: Update variable/function names for clarity
- [ ] **Step 3.3**: Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- [ ] **Step 3.4**: Optimize imports and dependencies
- [ ] **Step 3.5**: Run linter and fix any issues
- [ ] **Step 3.6**: Run full test suite

**Cleanup Checkpoint:** Code clean, tests passing

---

### Phase 4: Verification & Documentation

- [ ] **Step 4.1**: Run full test suite multiple times
- [ ] **Step 4.2**: Check test coverage - verify maintained/improved
- [ ] **Step 4.3**: Run performance benchmarks - verify no regression
- [ ] **Step 4.4**: Manual testing of affected features
- [ ] **Step 4.5**: Update documentation (README, CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] **Step 4.6**: Update code comments
- [ ] **Step 4.7**: Verify no console errors/warnings

**Verification Checkpoint:** All quality checks pass

---

## Post-Implementation Verification

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Functionality Verification**
   - [ ] Test all features that use refactored code
   - [ ] Verify behavior identical to before refactor
   - [ ] Check for any subtle changes

2. **Performance Testing**
   - [ ] Run performance benchmarks
   - [ ] Compare to baseline metrics
   - [ ] Verify no performance regression

3. **Integration Testing**
   - [ ] Test refactored code with dependent features
   - [ ] Verify data flows correctly
   - [ ] Check error handling

4. **Code Review Self-Check**
   - [ ] Read through refactored code
   - [ ] Verify it's clearer than before
   - [ ] Ensure patterns are consistent

### Metrics Comparison

| Metric                | Before | After | Change |
| --------------------- | ------ | ----- | ------ |
| Lines of Code         | X      | Y     | ¬±Z     |
| Cyclomatic Complexity | X      | Y     | ¬±Z     |
| Test Coverage         | X%     | Y%    | ¬±Z%    |
| Performance (ms)      | X      | Y     | ¬±Z     |
| Bundle Size (KB)      | X      | Y     | ¬±Z     |

## Rollback Plan

If this refactor causes issues:

1. **Revert commits**: `git revert <commit-range>`
2. **Restore previous code**: Ensure all refactored files restored
3. **Verify tests pass**: Run full test suite
4. **Document issues**: Note what went wrong
5. **Plan alternative approach**: Investigate different refactor strategy

**Rollback Risk:** Low | Medium | High
**Rollback Ease:** Easy - small changes | Moderate | Difficult - large changes

Files that need updating after this refactor:

- [ ] `README.md` - Update if architecture changed
