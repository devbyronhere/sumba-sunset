## Prerequisites/Dependencies

- [ ] Required accounts created (GitHub, Vercel, etc.)
- [ ] Access permissions granted
- [ ] Required tools installed locally
- [ ] Environment variables prepared
- [ ] Documentation reviewed
- [ ] Team notified of upcoming changes

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1**: Infrastructure/tooling is fully functional
- [ ] **AC2**: All configuration files created and committed
- [ ] **AC3**: Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] **AC4**: Team members can use the infrastructure
- [ ] **AC5**: Error handling and logging in place
- [ ] **AC6**: Rollback plan tested and documented

## Test Strategy

### How to Verify Infrastructure Works

Since this is infrastructure, testing looks different:

1. **Dry Run Tests**: Test setup in isolation before deploying
2. **Integration Tests**: Verify infrastructure works with project
3. **Failure Tests**: Intentionally break things to verify error handling
4. **Documentation Tests**: Follow docs to verify accuracy

### Verification Steps

- [ ] Trigger the infrastructure/pipeline manually
- [ ] Verify expected output/behavior
- [ ] Test error scenarios (wrong inputs, failures, etc.)
- [ ] Verify logs are helpful for debugging
- [ ] Test with different configurations
- [ ] Verify rollback procedure works

### Success Metrics

- Infrastructure setup time: < X minutes
- Build/deployment time: < X minutes
- Success rate: > 95%
- Error messages: Clear and actionable

---

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Research & Planning

- [ ] **Step 1.1**: Research best practices for this infrastructure
- [ ] **Step 1.2**: Review similar setups in other projects
- [ ] **Step 1.3**: Document configuration decisions
- [ ] **Step 1.4**: Create list of environment variables needed
- [ ] **Step 1.5**: Plan rollback strategy

**Planning Checkpoint:** Clear implementation plan with all decisions documented

---

### Phase 2: Local Setup & Testing

- [ ] **Step 2.1**: Install required tools locally
- [ ] **Step 2.2**: Create configuration files
- [ ] **Step 2.3**: Test configuration locally
- [ ] **Step 2.4**: Document any issues encountered
- [ ] **Step 2.5**: Refine configuration based on testing
- [ ] **Step 2.6**: Verify setup works on clean machine (if possible)

**Local Testing Checkpoint:** Infrastructure works locally

---

### Phase 3: Integration

- [ ] **Step 3.1**: Integrate infrastructure with project
- [ ] **Step 3.2**: Update package.json scripts (if needed)
- [ ] **Step 3.3**: Add necessary dependencies
- [ ] **Step 3.4**: Configure environment variables
- [ ] **Step 3.5**: Test integration end-to-end
- [ ] **Step 3.6**: Fix any integration issues

**Integration Checkpoint:** Infrastructure integrated with project

---

### Phase 4: Remote/Production Setup

- [ ] **Step 4.1**: Create remote accounts/services (if needed)
- [ ] **Step 4.2**: Configure remote settings
- [ ] **Step 4.3**: Set up environment variables remotely
- [ ] **Step 4.4**: Deploy/enable infrastructure
- [ ] **Step 4.5**: Test remote setup
- [ ] **Step 4.6**: Monitor for issues

**Production Checkpoint:** Infrastructure live and functional

---

### Phase 5: Documentation & Handoff

- [ ] **Step 5.1**: Create comprehensive setup documentation
- [ ] **Step 5.2**: Document troubleshooting steps
- [ ] **Step 5.3**: Add usage examples
- [ ] **Step 5.4**: Update README.md
- [ ] **Step 5.5**: Update CLAUDE.md with new commands/patterns
- [ ] **Step 5.6**: Create runbook for common operations
