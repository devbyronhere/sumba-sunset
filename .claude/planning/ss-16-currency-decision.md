# [Infrastructure] Currency Switch Spike - USD vs IDR Decision

## Overview

Research and make a final decision on whether to use USD or Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) as the primary currency for pricing and payments. This decision impacts all future development and must be made before building marketing pages.

As a business owner, I need to choose the optimal currency that maximizes bookings while minimizing operational complexity and currency conversion losses.

**Business Value:**

- Reduced friction in booking process
- Minimized currency conversion fees
- Simplified accounting
- Clear pricing for target market

## Research & Analysis Steps

### Phase 1: Market Research

**Data to Gather:**

- [ ] **Step 1.1**: Analyze target guest demographics:

  ```
  Questions to answer:
  - What % of guests are international vs domestic?
  - Which countries do most guests come from?
  - What currencies do competitors use?
  - What do guests expect to see?
  ```

- [ ] **Step 1.2**: Research competitor pricing:

  ```
  Surf camps to check:
  - Sumba surf camps
  - Bali surf camps
  - Similar Indonesian properties
  - Note their currency choice and why
  ```

- [ ] **Step 1.3**: Survey existing/past guests (if any):
  ```
  Questions:
  - Preferred currency for booking?
  - Confusion about pricing?
  - Payment method preferences?
  ```

**Market Research Checkpoint:** Guest preferences understood

---

### Phase 2: Technical Feasibility

**Technical Analysis:**

- [ ] **Step 2.1**: Test Beds24 currency options:

  ```
  Test both scenarios:
  1. Set to USD:
     - How does it display?
     - Payment processing flow?
     - Guest experience?

  2. Set to IDR:
     - Large number display (millions)?
     - International card processing?
     - Clarity for foreign guests?
  ```

- [ ] **Step 2.2**: Check Stripe capabilities:

  ```
  Research:
  - USD processing from Indonesia?
  - IDR processing fees?
  - Currency conversion at payment time?
  - Settlement currency options?
  ```

- [ ] **Step 2.3**: Bank account requirements:
  ```
  Check with bank:
  - USD account available?
  - Fees for USD vs IDR?
  - Conversion rates offered?
  - Wire transfer capabilities?
  ```

**Technical Checkpoint:** Systems support both options

---

### Phase 3: Financial Analysis

**Cost Comparison:**

- [ ] **Step 3.1**: Calculate USD scenario costs:

  ```
  USD Pricing Model:
  - Room rate: $100/night
  - Stripe fee: 2.9% + $0.30 = $3.20
  - Bank conversion (if needed): ~2%
  - Total cost per $100 booking: ~$5.20
  ```

- [ ] **Step 3.2**: Calculate IDR scenario costs:

  ```
  IDR Pricing Model:
  - Room rate: Rp 1,500,000/night
  - Stripe fee: 2.9% + Rp 5,000 = Rp 48,500
  - No conversion needed
  - Total cost per Rp 1,500,000: Rp 48,500
  ```

- [ ] **Step 3.3**: Model annual impact:

  ```
  Assumptions:
  - 200 bookings/year
  - Average booking: $300 (or Rp 4,500,000)

  USD Model Annual Fees: $_____
  IDR Model Annual Fees: Rp _____
  Difference: $_____
  ```

**Financial Checkpoint:** Cost difference quantified

## Notes

### Currency Considerations

**USD Considerations:**

- Most surf camps globally use USD
- Easier for Americans/Europeans
- Stable, recognized currency
- May seem "premium"

**IDR Considerations:**

- Authentic local experience
- Required for domestic bookings
- Simpler tax reporting
- No conversion losses

### Hybrid Approach (Not Recommended)

Showing both currencies adds complexity:

- Confusion about which is charged
- Exchange rate management
- Technical complexity
- Accounting nightmare

### Future Flexibility

Consider ability to switch later:

- Historical booking data
- Customer communication
- SEO impact of price changes
- Marketing material updates

### Regional Examples

**Bali Properties:**

- Luxury: Usually USD
- Mid-range: Mixed
- Budget: Usually IDR

**Competitor Analysis:**

- [Research specific competitors]
