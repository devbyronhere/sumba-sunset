# [Infrastructure] Beds24 Payment Configuration with Stripe

## Overview

Configure Stripe payment processing within Beds24 to handle the 50% deposit model. This includes setting up Stripe integration, configuring payment rules, testing payment flow, and ensuring PCI compliance through Beds24's secure payment handling.

**User Story:**
As a surf camp owner, I need automated payment processing so that deposits are collected at booking time without manual intervention.
