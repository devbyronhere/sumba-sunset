## Notes

### Important Beds24 Limitations

- Dashboard UI is dated - expect 1990s-style interface
- Configuration is complex - many nested menus
- Save frequently - some sections don't auto-save
- API has rate limits - don't hammer endpoints
- Channel manager setup is separate task (post-MVP)

### Time-Saving Tips

1. **Prepare all content first**: Room descriptions, policies, photos
2. **Use bulk operations**: When adding multiple similar rooms
3. **Test incrementally**: Don't wait until end to test
4. **Document everything**: IDs, settings, configuration choices
5. **Ask support**: Beds24 support is helpful for complex setup

### Currency Decision Impact

Based on Milestone 3 currency decision (SS-16):

- If USD: Keep all pricing in USD throughout
- If IDR: Convert all pricing to IDR, update currency setting
