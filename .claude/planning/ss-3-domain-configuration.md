# [Infrastructure] Domain Configuration - Point Hostinger Domain to Vercel

## Overview

Configure DNS settings in Hostinger to point the `sumbasunset.com` domain to Vercel's hosting platform. This is a manual configuration task that connects the domain purchased from Hostinger to the application hosted on Vercel.

**Infrastructure Type:** Configuration (DNS)
**Impact:** Production domain access
**Risk Level:** Low (can revert DNS changes anytime)

**Business Value:**

- Enable production domain (sumbasunset.com) instead of Vercel's default URL
- Professional branding for marketing and SEO
- Automatic SSL certificate provisioning by Vercel
- Unblock production launch

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Situation

- Domain `sumbasunset.com` purchased from Hostinger
- Application hosted on Vercel with temporary URL (e.g., `sumba-sunset-xxx.vercel.app`)
- Domain and hosting are not connected
- Cannot launch to production with custom domain

### Desired Outcome

After this task:

- `sumbasunset.com` points to Vercel hosting
- `www.sumbasunset.com` redirects to root domain
- Vercel automatically provisions SSL certificate
- DNS changes propagated globally
- Production site accessible at custom domain

---

## Solution Design

### DNS Configuration Flow

```
1. Add Domain in Vercel Dashboard
   ‚Üì
2. Vercel Provides DNS Records
   ‚Üì
3. Update DNS in Hostinger Dashboard
   ‚Üì
4. Wait for DNS Propagation (5 min - 48 hours)
   ‚Üì
5. Vercel Provisions SSL Certificate
   ‚Üì
6. Domain Live with HTTPS
```

### Configuration Method

**Option 1: A Records + CNAME (Recommended)**

- Keep Hostinger as DNS host
- Update A record to point to Vercel's IP
- Update CNAME for www subdomain
- Easier to manage, familiar interface

**Option 2: Nameserver Change**

- Change nameservers to Vercel's
- All DNS managed in Vercel
- More complex, requires moving all DNS records

**Decision: Use Option 1** (A Records + CNAME) for simplicity

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Add Domain in Vercel (USER - 5 minutes)

- [x] **Step 1.1**: Log into Vercel dashboard
- [x] **Step 1.2**: Select the sumba-sunset project
- [x] **Step 1.3**: Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Domains**
- [x] **Step 1.4**: Click **Add Domain**
- [x] **Step 1.5**: Enter `sumbasunset.com`
- [x] **Step 1.6**: Click **Add**
- [x] **Step 1.7**: Vercel will show DNS configuration instructions
- [x] **Step 1.8**: Document the DNS records provided:
  - ALIAS Record: `*` ‚Üí `cname.vercel-dns-017.com` (TTL: 60)
  - ALIAS Record: `*` ‚Üí `86b01e065c64be87.vercel-dns-017.com` (TTL: 60)
  - CAA Record: `@` ‚Üí `0 issue "letsencrypt.org"` (TTL: 60)
- [x] **Step 1.9**: Optionally add `www.sumbasunset.com` as well (recommended)

**Checkpoint:** DNS records documented, ready to update Hostinger

---

### Phase 2: Update Nameservers in Hostinger (USER - 10 minutes)

**Note:** Nameserver approach used instead of individual DNS record updates. This gives Vercel full DNS management control.

- [x] **Step 2.1**: Log into Hostinger account
- [x] **Step 2.2**: Navigate to **Domains** section
- [x] **Step 2.3**: Select `sumbasunset.com`
- [x] **Step 2.4**: Find **Nameservers** section
- [x] **Step 2.5**: Change nameservers to Vercel's:
  - Nameserver 1: `ns1.vercel-dns.com`
  - Nameserver 2: `ns2.vercel-dns.com`
- [x] **Step 2.6**: Save nameserver changes
- [x] **Step 2.7**: Document timestamp of nameserver change
- [x] **Step 2.8**: Note: DNS management now handled by Vercel (Hostinger DNS panel disabled)

**Checkpoint:** Nameservers updated to Vercel, DNS management transferred

---

### Phase 2.5: Verify DNS Records in Vercel Dashboard (USER - 5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Confirm Vercel has automatically configured DNS records after nameserver change.

- [x] **Step 2.5.1**: Return to Vercel dashboard
- [x] **Step 2.5.2**: Navigate to **Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains**
- [x] **Step 2.5.3**: Click on `sumbasunset.com` domain
- [x] **Step 2.5.4**: Verify domain status shows one of:
  - "Valid Configuration" (green checkmark)
  - "Pending Verification" (waiting for nameserver propagation)
  - No errors about misconfiguration
- [x] **Step 2.5.5**: Check DNS records (if Vercel shows them):
  - ALIAS records with wildcard (\*) ‚Üí Vercel DNS hostnames ‚úÖ
  - CAA record for Let's Encrypt SSL ‚úÖ
  - Note: Nameserver approach uses ALIAS records instead of A/AAAA records
  - Wildcard covers all subdomains (www, api, etc.) automatically
- [x] **Step 2.5.7**: Document Vercel's reported status and timestamp
  - Status: **Valid Configuration** ‚úÖ
  - Verified: 2025-10-25
  - All DNS records configured correctly by Vercel

**Checkpoint:** Vercel DNS configuration verified and valid ‚úÖ

---

### Phase 3: Wait for Nameserver Propagation (USER - 5 minutes - 48 hours)

- [x] **Step 3.1**: Note the time nameserver changes were saved
- [x] **Step 3.2**: Wait at least 5 minutes before testing
- [x] **Step 3.3**: Check nameserver propagation with online tools:
  - Visit: https://www.whatsmydns.net
  - Enter: `sumbasunset.com`
  - Select "NS" record type
  - Check nameservers show `ns1.vercel-dns.com` and `ns2.vercel-dns.com` globally
- [NA] **Step 3.5**: If not propagated, wait longer (nameserver changes can take up to 48 hours)

**Checkpoint:** Nameservers propagated globally, DNS now managed by Vercel

---

### Phase 4: Verify Domain & SSL (USER - 5 minutes)

- [x] **Step 4.1**: Visit `http://sumbasunset.com` (note: http not https)
- [x] **Step 4.2**: Verify site loads (may redirect to https automatically)
- [x] **Step 4.3**: Visit `https://sumbasunset.com`
- [x] **Step 4.4**: Verify SSL certificate is valid:
  - Click padlock icon in browser
  - Check certificate issued by "Let's Encrypt" via Vercel
  - Verify no certificate errors
- [x] **Step 4.5**: Visit `https://www.sumbasunset.com`
- [x] **Step 4.6**: Verify it redirects to `https://sumbasunset.com`
- [x] **Step 4.7**: Test on mobile device (actual phone, not just browser resize)
- [x] **Step 4.8**: Check browser console for any errors
- [x] **Step 4.9**: Verify no mixed content warnings (HTTP resources on HTTPS page)

**Checkpoint:** Domain live with SSL

---

### Phase 5: Documentation (CLAUDE - 5 minutes)

- [x] **Step 5.1**: Claude updates CLAUDE.md with domain status
- [x] **Step 5.2**: Claude updates README.md with production URL
- [x] **Step 5.3**: Claude updates planning index
- [x] **Step 5.4**: Claude documents DNS configuration for future reference

**Checkpoint:** Documentation complete

---

## Post-Implementation Verification

### Manual Testing Steps (USER REQUIRED)

1. **DNS Propagation Check**
   - [x] Visit https://www.whatsmydns.net
   - [x] Enter `sumbasunset.com`
   - [x] Verify A record shows Vercel's IP in all regions
   - [x] Repeat for `www.sumbasunset.com` (CNAME check)

2. **Domain Access Test**
   - [x] Open incognito/private browser window
   - [x] Visit `sumbasunset.com` (no protocol)
   - [x] Verify site loads with HTTPS
   - [x] Visit `www.sumbasunset.com`
   - [x] Verify redirects to root domain

3. **SSL Certificate Test**
   - [x] Visit `https://sumbasunset.com`
   - [x] Click padlock icon
   - [x] Verify certificate valid and issued by "Let's Encrypt"
   - [x] Check certificate expiry date (should be ~90 days)
   - [x] Verify Vercel auto-renews (no action needed)

4. **Mobile Device Test**
   - [x] Open `sumbasunset.com` on actual phone
   - [x] Verify site loads quickly
   - [x] Check SSL padlock shows in mobile browser
   - [x] Test navigation works

5. **Browser Compatibility Test**
   - [x] Chrome: Visit `sumbasunset.com`
   - [x] Safari: Visit `sumbasunset.com`
   - [x] Firefox: Visit `sumbasunset.com`
   - [x] Check console for errors in each

---

## Rollback Plan

If domain configuration causes issues:

1. **Revert DNS Records in Hostinger**:
   - Change A record back to Hostinger's IP (if previously hosted there)
   - OR remove A record entirely (domain will be offline)
   - Save changes and wait for propagation

2. **Remove Domain from Vercel**:
   - Go to Vercel ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
   - Click the domain
   - Click "Remove"

3. **Fallback URL**:
   - Application remains accessible at `sumba-sunset-xxx.vercel.app`
   - No functionality lost, only URL changes

**Rollback Risk:** Very Low (DNS changes are reversible)
**Rollback Time:** 5 minutes + DNS propagation
**Impact:** Domain temporarily offline during rollback

---

## Documentation Updates

Files that need updating after this task:

- [x] `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Update domain status from "TBD" to "Active"
- [x] `README.md` - Update live site URL
- [x] `.claude/planning/index.md` - Mark task complete
- [x] This file - Add completion notes

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: DNS Not Propagating After 1 Hour

**Symptoms:** `dig sumbasunset.com` still shows old IP or no IP

**Solutions:**

1. Clear local DNS cache:
   - **Mac**: `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder`
   - **Windows**: `ipconfig /flushdns`
   - **Linux**: `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches`
2. Check Hostinger DNS saved correctly (go back to DNS Zone, verify)
3. Wait longer - some ISPs cache DNS for 24-48 hours
4. Try different network (mobile hotspot, coffee shop wifi)

---

### Issue: SSL Certificate Not Provisioning

**Symptoms:** Site loads but shows "Not Secure" or certificate error

**Solutions:**

1. Wait 10-15 minutes after DNS propagates (Vercel needs time)
2. Check Vercel dashboard for SSL status (Settings ‚Üí Domains ‚Üí SSL)
3. Verify DNS records point to correct Vercel servers
4. Remove and re-add domain in Vercel to trigger new SSL request
5. Contact Vercel support if issue persists after 1 hour

---

### Issue: www Subdomain Not Redirecting

**Symptoms:** `www.sumbasunset.com` shows error or doesn't redirect

**Solutions:**

1. Verify CNAME record added in Hostinger for `www`
2. Add `www.sumbasunset.com` as separate domain in Vercel
3. Vercel automatically redirects www ‚Üí root if both added
4. Check DNS propagation for www subdomain separately

---

### Issue: Mixed Content Warnings

**Symptoms:** Padlock shows warning, some resources load over HTTP

**Solutions:**

1. Check all image URLs use HTTPS or relative paths
2. Check external scripts/stylesheets use HTTPS
3. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` env variable to use HTTPS
4. Search codebase for hardcoded `http://` URLs

---

## Notes

**Important Reminders:**

1. **DNS propagation varies** - can be 5 minutes or 48 hours, be patient
2. **Don't delete old DNS records** before adding new ones (causes downtime)
3. **Test in incognito** to avoid browser cache issues
4. **Vercel auto-renews SSL** - no manual renewal needed every 90 days
5. **Keep Vercel default URL** as fallback (never delete)

**After Completion:**

1. Update all marketing materials with production URL
2. Update social media links
3. Submit to Google Search Console (future - SEO task)
4. Set up Google Analytics with production domain (future)
5. Monitor uptime with UptimeRobot (future)

## Retrospective

_(Fill out after completion)_

### What Went Well

- **Nameserver approach simplified everything** - Using Vercel nameservers instead of individual DNS records meant Vercel auto-configured all DNS records (ALIAS, CAA)
- **Very fast propagation** - Nameservers propagated almost instantly, Vercel showed "Valid Configuration" immediately
- **Documentation was thorough** - Planning document adapted well when we switched from A record approach to nameserver approach
- **User created custom email** - Proactive addition of `info@sumbasunset.com` (though MX records still need configuration)
- **All quality gates passed** - Domain, SSL, www redirect all working perfectly

### What Could Improve

- **Initial plan assumed A records** - Had to adapt documentation mid-task when user chose nameserver approach (but adaptation went smoothly)
- **Email setup incomplete** - Custom email created but MX records not yet added to Vercel DNS (follow-up task needed)
- **Google Search Console pending** - Verification TXT record discussed but not yet added (minor follow-up)

### DNS Records Configured

```
Type: ALIAS
Name: * (wildcard)
Value: cname.vercel-dns-017.com
TTL: 60

Type: ALIAS
Name: * (wildcard)
Value: 86b01e065c64be87.vercel-dns-017.com
TTL: 60

Type: CAA
Name: @ (root)
Value: 0 issue "letsencrypt.org"
TTL: 60
```

**Note:** ALIAS records automatically configured by Vercel when nameservers were changed. Wildcard (\*) covers all subdomains.

### Vercel Domain Status

- Verified: 2025-10-25
- Status: **Valid Configuration** ‚úÖ
- DNS Management: Vercel (via nameservers)
- All records auto-configured successfully

### Propagation Time

- Nameservers changed at: [timestamp when user changed in Hostinger]
- Vercel verification: Instant (Valid Configuration on first check)
- Total propagation time: Very fast (nameservers propagated quickly)

### Issues Encountered

- **Hostinger DNS panel disabled after nameserver change** - Expected behavior, but initially unclear why user couldn't manage DNS in Hostinger. Resolved by explaining Vercel now manages DNS.
- **Confusion about ALIAS vs A records** - Planning doc expected A/AAAA records, but Vercel uses ALIAS records with nameserver approach. Updated documentation to reflect reality.
- **Email MX records not configured** - User created `info@sumbasunset.com` email but we haven't yet added MX records to Vercel DNS, so email won't work yet (follow-up needed).

### Follow-up Tasks Created

- [ ] SS-XX: Add Google Search Console TXT verification record to Vercel DNS
- [ ] SS-XX: Configure MX records in Vercel DNS for Hostinger email (`info@sumbasunset.com`)

---

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-25
**Actual Time Spent:** 45 minutes active work (excluding DNS propagation wait)
**Propagation Wait:** Instant (nameservers propagated very quickly)
**Final Status:** ‚úÖ Completed

**Key Achievements:**

- Domain live at https://sumbasunset.com with SSL
- Nameserver approach chosen and implemented successfully
- All documentation updated (README, CLAUDE.md, Planning Index)
- Custom email created (MX configuration pending)
- Production domain ready for development and future launch
